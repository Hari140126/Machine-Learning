# Traffic Forecast System

## Project Overview
The Traffic Forecast System is a **Machine Learning project** designed to predict traffic patterns using historical traffic data. The project leverages **time series forecasting techniques** to help anticipate traffic congestion and improve traffic management.

---

## Dataset
- The dataset used for this project contains historical traffic data, including timestamps and traffic volume.  
- **File:** `traffic_data.csv`  
- **Source:** Collected from [your data source] or created for the project.  

---

## Features
The main features used for forecasting include:
- Date and time information
- Traffic volume/count
- Other relevant features (e.g., day of week, weather if included)  

---

## Model Used
- **Time Series Forecasting** techniques
- Example models used:
  - ARIMA
  - LSTM (if applied)
  - Prophet (if applied)  
*(You can mention whichever model you implemented in your notebook.)*
